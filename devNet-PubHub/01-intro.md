# Introduction

Enterprises have been using On-Premise CUCM for a very long time. With time, the configurations have gotten so complex that, migrating CUCM from on-premise to the cloud or even from one CUCM cluster to another CUCM cluster, seems like a nightmare.

This lab session (part of Cisco Live Devnet Workshop: DEVWKS-2116 ) will help you break that nightmare into achievable steps, making the data migration a less complex process, while taking care of all CUCM Config dependencies.

This lab assumes, you know the basics of CUCM AXL and the nuances of Python. In this lab, you will combine your learning of Python with CUCM AXL API to create workflows for migrating data from one CUCM cluster to another CUCM cluster, ensuring dependencies flow along.

This lab can be used for primary understanding of migration workflow with some easy-to-understand labs, which can be extrapolated based on your environment to perform a more complex task.

With all of that out of the way, let's get started!!

## Objectives

- Understand CUCM dependency records
- Understand CUCM AXL API
- Learn how to write custom logic with CUCM AXL Python Library
