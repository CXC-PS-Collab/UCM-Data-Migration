# Introduction

Enterprises has been using On-Premise CUCM for a very long time. With time, the configurations have gotten so complex that migrating CUCM from on-premise to cloud or even from one CUCM cluster to another CUCM cluster, does seem like a nightmare.

This lab session (part of Cisco Live Devnet Workshop: DEVWKS-2116 ) will help you break that nightmare into achievable steps, making the data migration a less complex process, while taking care of all dependencies of CUCM configurations

You know the basics of CUCM AXL and also understand the nuances of Python. In this lab, you will combine your learning of Python with CUCM AXL API to create workflows for migrating data from one CUCM cluster to another CUCM cluster, ensuring dependencies flow through

This lab can be used for primary understanding of migration workflow with some easy-to-understand labs, which can be extrapolated based on your environment to perform a more complex task.

With all of that out of the way, let's get started!

## Objectives

- Understand CUCM dependency records
- Understand CUCM AXL API
- Learn how to write custom logic with CUCM AXL Python Library
