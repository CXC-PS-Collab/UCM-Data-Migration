Great !!! So you have decided to take on this adventure ü•Å, but before we get some action.. lets understand the pre-reqs.

# Prerequisites and Credentials

- Python 3.x - Provided in this lab browser environment
- Access to CUCM enviroment through VPN
  - CUCM 12.5 (_Source Cluster_): ```<IP address>```
  - CUCM 14 (_Destination Cluster_): ```<IP address>```
  - Login Credentials:
    - Username: ```devnetXX```
    - Password: ```devnet@123```
- VPN Credentials:
  - Server: ```<IP Address>```
  - Username: ```devnetXX```
  - Password: ```devnet@123```
  

# Setting Environment

> Clone Code Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CXC-PS-Collab/DEVWKS-2116.git
```

> Setup python environment

```bash
cd ~/src/UCM-Data-Migration
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Connect to Cisco VPN to access CUCM labs

```bash
export VPN_SERVER=vpn_server
export VPN_USERNAME=username
export VPN_PASSWORD=password
./startvpn.sh
```
